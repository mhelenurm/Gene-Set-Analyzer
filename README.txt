Gene-Set-Analyzer
=================

This repo is the *useful* code behind my website which uses the Homolgene database to do set operations on sets of genes.

The database and my website are hosted by Bluehost; web address is: http://www.geneset.helenurmdev.com

Ignore the fact that the site looks pretty aweful. C'mon, I'm a programmer, not a graphic designer!
